        <p>A scan of the latest issue of Weekly Young Jump magazine, officially releasing Thursday March 12, revealed that One and Yusuke Murata's manga One Punch-Man will get a TV anime adaptation. A promotional video, which will be presented at Bandai Visual's booth at the Anime Japan 2015 event on March 21-22, will announce the cast and staff members for the TV series. According to One, Yusuke Murata is also participating in the anime production.

          One began serializing the webcomic One Punch-Man on his own website in 2009. Yusuke Murata collaborated with One to remake the webcomic into a manga series in 2012 which is serialized in the online version of Weekly Young Jump.
          
          The manga follows Saitama, an average-looking fellow with a bald head and lifeless expressions, who is actually a superhero and bored of battling weak opponents. He embarks on a journey to find a worthy opponent that can withstand his one-punch fighting technique.

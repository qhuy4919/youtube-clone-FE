Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.

            Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power.
